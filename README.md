# The Coffee Run

This game is named "The Coffee Run". 

The intent of the game is to provide the player with a fun and comical experience about endlessly retrieving coffee for a character while avoiding coffee - crazed women. 

The narrative of the game is a character that undertakes the great task of endlessly getting coffee for a character that does not seem to fully appreciate all the work you are doing for him. Throughout the game the character must learn the map, how to avoid the women, and make use of the environment to do so. 

The mechanics of the game include interacting with NPCs, picking up coffee by walking over it, and avoiding certain characters. If these characters touch the player, progress will be reset!

The aesthetics of the game are pixel art. The characters are pixelated and the same thing is true for the environment. 

I enjoyed creating this game very much. I liked making different types of player feedback such as a confetti explosion, a few sounds, and a particle trail. I also enjoyed balancing the speed of the player and the characters so that the game was balanced.
